6/7/2016 - "How to Make Your Codebase a Joyful Place"

Abstract
========
* This talk is about how teams can maintain healthy codebases which we can be
proud of and help cultivate developer happiness.

1. What is good code? What is a well-maintained project? Is this an objective
phenomenon or "I know it when I see it"?

2. How do teams agree on what good code is and best practices are? How do we
improve these standards over time? Who makes final judgement calls? Why is
talking about this so hard?

3. How can we use robots to enforce whatever we agree to? How can we automate
as much of the above as possible to make jerks out of robots?
